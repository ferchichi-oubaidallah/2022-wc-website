        This is a record of France's results at the FIFA World Cup. France was one of the four European teams that participated at the inaugural World Cup in 1930 and have appeared in 15 FIFA World Cups, tied for the sixth most of any country.[1] The national team is one of eight to have won the FIFA World Cup title and one of only six to have done so more than once.[2]

The French team won its first World Cup title in 1998.[3] The tournament was played on home soil and France defeated Brazil 3–0 in the final match.[4][5][6][7] The tournament was hosted in France once before in 1938, where France was eliminated by defending champions Italy in the quarter-finals. In 2018, France won the World Cup for the second time, defeating Croatia 4–2 in the final at the Luzhniki Stadium in Russia.[8]

In 2006, France finished as runners-up, losing on penalties (5–3) to Italy after the game was tied 1–1 after 120 minutes.      <br />

      Brazil has taken home the World Cup five times in total. The country outdid the teams like Sweden (in 1958), Chezchoslovakia (in 1962), Italy (in 1970 and 1994) and Germany (in 2014).

      The biggest goal difference by which the country defeated the opponent has been 3. Here is how the final score sheet looked like:
      
      Brazil – Sweden: 5-2, year 1958
      Brazil – Italy: 4-1, year 1970
      Brazil – Chezchoslovakia, 3-1, year 1962
      Brazil – Italy: 3-2 penalty shoot-out decided winner
      Brazil – Germany: 2-0, year 2002
      Since 2002, Brazil has not reached the final of the FIFA World Cup. It gets the toughest fights mostly from Italy which is considered its arch rival.        <br />

      How many times has Germany been to the World Cup?
  Germany at the FIFA World Cup. The team was present in 19 out of the 21 tournaments, the second most frequent, and only did not reach the quarterfinals twice, in 1938 and 2018. With this, Germany's 8th place or better (quarterfinals) in 17 out of 19 tournaments (89%) ranks highest in FIFA World Cup Finals history.
     Germany (then West Germany) won their first ever World Cup in the 1954 tournament in Switzerland, defeating Hungary 3-2 in what is widely considered as one of the best finals in World Cup history. Hungary came into the final as arguably the best team in the world and the favourites to be World Cup winners
